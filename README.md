# research-projects
Two research projects I did for one of my professors.

PolarityGraph.py is an implementation of an algorithm that was the subject of a paper for the IEA-AIE 2018 Conference in Montreal. Its focused on obtaining a polarity for a specific word given a limited lexicon by using a graph of its synonyms.

The second is a probabilistic neural network (PNN) that trains on college application data for a specific school and then predicts an applicants chance of acceptance.
